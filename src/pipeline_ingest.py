"""Ingest → normalise → aggregate raw validations (62M rows, ~10 GB CSV) with DuckDB in ~1 min on a laptop.
Steps: parse CSV (lenient) → typed columns → keep successful validations (validation_result=1) → route from ngpt_route
→ drop duplicates (device_no, tran_no, ts) → timestamp = tran_date_time (input_date_time is unreliable)
→ hourly boardings per route (+ unique cards, device counts) → verify against organizer labels.
Usage: python src/pipeline_ingest.py [csv ...]   (default: train.csv test.csv)"""
